After diagramming has been completed, we elected to go with a test first development methodology.
The fundamental ideology is to begin with unit tests.
	These tests will ensure basic logical soundness of all branches of the code.
	We will also endeavour to make sure the inputs are sanity tested with boundary tests, which have the purpose of accepting sane inputs and being capable of dealing with edge cases.
	These will be covered in the testing section 1.
After unit tests have been completed, the next task is to ensure the system functions properly with system tests.
	The ideology behind these tests is so ensure that the system in its entirety is functioning as expected, producing expected results.
	These will be covered in the testing section 2.
	

Testing Section 1.
	These tests are automated, they will not involve entering in physical input, simply running the JUnit test cases we developed for our software.
	

Testing Section 2.
	These test are non-automated, these will involve the tester physically entering the inputs and actually using the software we have developed.
