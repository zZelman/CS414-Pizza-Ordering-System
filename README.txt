README!

Hello! thanks for reading the readme! We appreciate it!

We had a ton of fun working on this assignment.

our external dependencies are - gradle, JUnit, and the android sdk

to run from a command line you first need to make sure you have gradle and stuffs running, but it goes as:
gradle server
gradle ManagerGui
gradle KioskGui
gradle ChefGUI
gradle DeliveryGUI
gradle AndroidGui

We feel like our gui's are way better thanks to your help, but i mean we still aren't HCI majors who know how to make sweet GUIs
So it is a bit rudementary and we worried more with functionality than the actual appearance of said GUIs, but they do look better than last time

our patterns for refactoring were focused on model-view separation, we made use of facades, and we made sure to have a clear separation of the user interface layer from the application layer and the domain layer
