The idea we will be going with moving forward is test first development (We technically started with all of our diagramming and SSD's).
We will be making tests for all basic logic functions which include all branches of the logic,
Then we will boundary test each function in order to assure that is only accepts logical input and properly handles what happens when it does not receive proper input
After it passes that, we will be doing generic system functionality tests in order to ensure that the entire system is working as intended
